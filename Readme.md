# GrubHub For iPad #

I was sick of going to GrubHub in Safari, cause that damn toolbar at the top never goes away. So I stuck it in a UIWebView, gave it some gesture recognizers, and then used it to order some shrimp fried rice.

### Gestures ###
- Swipe Right to Go Back.
- Swipe Left to Go Forward.
- Rotate with 2 fingers to Refresh.

Happy eating.
